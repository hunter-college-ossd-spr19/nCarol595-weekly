**What things do you feel you need to learn the most to be able to contribute to open source projects?**

I feel like one of the things that I need to learn the most is to be _confident_. I think this will help me just dive in and contribute, as well as to socialize. I am constantly afraid to ask questions not just in person, and I think that I need to learn to be confident enough to ask a question. This will also make it is easier to contribute to a project and get to know the community of people behing the open source project.




**What are the weak points that you want to strengthen?**
 
 I want to stregthen my _coding_ and _coding documentation_. I think by contributing to projects I can learn more about how to and how not to code. I want to be able to optimize my code and be able to read code and understand what is going on. I also want to become better at documenting my code and I believe that by reading code from other projects will help me further understand how to do this.
