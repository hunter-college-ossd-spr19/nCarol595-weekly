## Progress Report

So because of the lack of securing an issue to fix, we have collectively decided to write guide articles. I'm also working 
on fixing a [coding challenge](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/curriculum/challenges/english/04-data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart.english.md) 
that has readability issues. I am thinking of writing a guide article on importing data or on data frames. I am relying on my
experience using R and what information was harder to find to choose a topic to write about.
