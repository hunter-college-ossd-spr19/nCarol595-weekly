## Opinion on Patrick Mason's Talk

I really enjoyed the talk. I think the information was very helpful in getting rid of some of my fear to contirbute to open source. 
It also opened up my understand of what open source is and how to contribute. I also became more aware of the projects that exist that
are open source.


## Progress Report: 

We had tried to zero in on a project to work on but there seems to always be people ready to jump on an open issue. I did start looking
into writing a [guide article](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/r) instead. That is an option, the other would be to try to write
a challenge, or perhaps translate some of the challenges to another language.
