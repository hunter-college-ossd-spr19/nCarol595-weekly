## About the 2 articles
What I found interesting about the "Understanding personality types in open source" article is how true it all of it was.
I am the type of person who learns better or understands better by reading a document as opposed to just being shown a diagram.  I believe that had I not taken this class I probably would have never involved myself in open source. I consider this class in a way a kind of outreach. I think a classroom is a place where different personality types
gather together. The added push this class gave me has made me see how simple it is to contribute to
open source. 

When I think of Linux I have never really thought of the journey it took for that operating
system to get to where it is now. I like how Linus discusses hia experience and how things have changed
for him. One topic discussed in this article that I do not completely agree with is the subject of social media. 
I don't have social media myself, but at some point I did. I am a believer that social media can be very useful in
outreaching for support in a cause, that otherwise would not have another way to gain such momentum. 

## Progress Report:

I finished writing my guide article and will in the next few days make a pull request. I settled on
writing about data frames because it is one of the core things to know when using R.
