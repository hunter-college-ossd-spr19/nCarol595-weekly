**So, I decided I want to work on the Open Source NYC project**

On that note, one of the main reasons for my decision is the premise of the project. I
I honestly believe that my coding skills aren't great, so I think coding wouldn't be my strong suit but I would like to make
some contributions to the coding ascpect. 

I do believe one of my strengths can be designing the visuals or making the web interface. I am hoping that throughout the course of this project
I can strengthen my back-end coding skills a bit.
