### The question at hand:
**Comment on your experience with the project evaluation assignment. 
For example, was it useful? Was it very time-consuming? How would you assess 
the activity level of a project? Can you propose other ways of doing this? Try to back up your ideas with some reasons.**

I honestly believe it was time-consuming because I had to look through the issues and pull requests and 
the documentation for the software. I found that it was useful to see how issues and pull requests are made and the subsequent
discussion. I think it is helpful to know and see how to submit an issue and what to include depending on the question being asked. 

I want to say that there is an easier way to do this, but there really isn't. I think it is very useful to be able to try to find the 
necessary information to download the software and see how useful the documentation is once it is found. I believe looking at pull requests and issues help 
to assess how helpful the maintainers and contributors are. It believe it also aids in deciding whether to get involved with the project or not, especially
if welcomeness is important to someone.
