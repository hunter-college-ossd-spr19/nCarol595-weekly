## Updates on the project:
So the pull request link is: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35845
I started brainstorming ideas for another R guide article I plan to write:

1. OOP in R: I don't know how I would do this one, but I would just focus on one type of class you can create in R and the basics of it.
2. The apply() function family: I would just focus on one specific function and its uses. I have personally used these functions and believe they are very useful to know. 
3. Specific package: I have used 2 very helpful packages in R and perhaps it would be helpful tto create a basic article about one of them. Maybe using an example of how I used it.
