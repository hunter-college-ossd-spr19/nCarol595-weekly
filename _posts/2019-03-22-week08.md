## Progress report 

There hasn't been any progress on the project. I have been looking at possible fixes I can make to start with. It has been hard to 
isolate a possible issue because of the rate at which they are taken. I have decided to start looking into possibly doing some
translating to spanish. I am still considering writing a guide article. I would create an article for the [programming language R](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/r). I am 
considering what topic to write a guide article about.
