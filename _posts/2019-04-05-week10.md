## Progess Report

I made a [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35702) for the [coding challenge](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/curriculum/challenges/english/04-data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart.english.md) 
that I noticed had a readability issue. The pull request got denied but I am glad I did it. Apparently the coding challenge lacked readability
when seen on github but on [their site](https://www.freecodecamp.rocks/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart) the
article was formatted correctly. 

I decided to write a guide article on data frames. I will start by making an outline of what I will write, and any
useful links I want to add that helped me when learning R. I also looked over FreeCodeCamp's [style guide for creating and editing guide articles](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/style-guide-for-guide-articles.md)
to prep in advance.
