1. **My understanding of Free Software vs. Open Source** : 
Open Source according to the article is a program that can be used and redistributed by anyone.
It is a program wherein the source code can be modified and can be integrated into other software.
The program remains open source even when it is modified, meaning they must operate under the original license
and are open source as well.
On the other hand Free Software is a philosophy. According to the reading in order for a software to be
**free** it must adhere to four essential freedoms. The terminology **free** does not refer to pricing, it 
is about ability to have the freddom to do as you wish with the software.
