**Issues I Think I Can Fix**

1. So there is [this](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/r)
  
   * You can contribute by adding new guides for different programming languages
  to the freecodecamp website
  I myself know R and can write a section on data frames and how to manipulate and use them, as well 
  as provide examples
  
2. I can also do [this](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#translate-guide-articles-and-coding-challenges)

   * I can contribute by translating coding languages to new language, I happen to know a intermediate amount of French 
   and can possibly translate it
  
3. I can also work to fix [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/timeout-has-occurred-how-to-use-package-json-challenge/265881)
    
    * I believe I can fix this problem because I believe I can replicate the error made and see what is causing it. 
    
    

**` NOTE: I wasn't sure if all the issues had to be coding related but the last one in my list is.`**
