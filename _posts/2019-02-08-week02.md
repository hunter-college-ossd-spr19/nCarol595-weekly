Week 2
======
**1. What do you think should be your first contributions to an open source project? Bear in mind the various ways that someone can contribute, and refer back to the webpages that discussed this if you need to.**

Honestly I feel like I would like my first contributions to an open source project to be translating the documentation to another language (provided that I understand the documentation). I think even just translating the whole installation process of a software is helpful to anyone trying to use it.

**2. What kind of project would be your ideal project to support? For example, a humanitarian project, a game engine, a part of a big application like Gnome or Firefox? Try to be realistic; given how much time you have during this semester, what is your goal?**

I was looking a lot into codeTriage and I think I would like to contribute to their project. I would like to be able to start somewhere and I would also like to become a bettter developer. I feel like contributing to that project will be a mutually beneficial goal.
